# M-WET Fouling System SAXS/WAXS Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for processing/analyzing transmission x-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) images collected at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source using the M-WET membrane fouling system. These experiments were designed to monitor the changes in the membrane structure caused by nanoparticle fouling (SAXS) and mineral scaling (WAXS) during membrane-based water purification experiments,, but the analysis workflows are applicable to a wide range of time-resolved SAXS/WAXS images collected at ALS beamline 7.3.3

# Scripts
1. **saxs_analysis.ipynb**  This script processes SAXS images collected during particle fouling experiments
2. **waxs_analysis.ipynb**  This script processes WAXS images collected during mineral scaling experiments
3. **membrane_analysis.ipynb**  This script processes the metadata (membrane performance and feedwater chemistry)
