# M-WET Fouling System SAXS/WAXS Analysis
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for processing/analyzing transmission x-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) images collected at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source using the M-WET membrane fouling system. These experiments were designed to monitor the changes in the membrane structure caused by nanoparticle fouling (SAXS) and mineral scaling (WAXS) during membrane-based water purification experiments,, but the analysis workflows are applicable to a wide range of time-resolved SAXS/WAXS images collected at ALS beamline 7.3.3.

This repository corresponds to the analyses performed in the following peer-reviewed publication:
